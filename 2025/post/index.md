## What do we do?
The [Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST)](https://post.parliament.uk/) is a research and knowledge exchange service. It works to ensure that the best available research, evidence and information informs the legislative process and Parliament's scrutiny of Government. It primarily supports the select committees of both Houses.

## Find our work
