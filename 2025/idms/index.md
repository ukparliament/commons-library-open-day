# Indexing and Data Management Section

## What do we do?  

We publish [weeknotes](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/) on an irregular basis. Our work includes:

### Subject indexing 
We subject index parliamentary business of the Commons and the Lords, supporting researchers and others to find what they need.

### Taxonomy services
We maintain a controlled vocabulary to cover the business of both Houses. The vocabulary is emergent from parliamentary business. We consult with colleagues across Parliament, making best use of their procedural and subject matter expertise. 

### Procedural data management 
We have domain expertise. The team understands parliamentary procedure across both Houses. We adapt our information management as business practice and procedure changes. We work with procedural colleagues in the Lords and the Commons. 

### Member data management
We look after the central database for Members of Parliament, keeping it up to date with new starters and leavers, party affiliation changes and changes to the machinery of government. We collaborate with the History of Parliament Trust on a database covering the social background of MPs since 1832, and another covering peerages in the Kingdoms of England, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom from 1603 to the present day. 

### Data integration and data cleaning 
We tie together information from disparate procedural systems. We make links in data that reflect how parliamentary business actually happened. 

### Data modelling 
We document parliamentary procedures. We work with internal and external domain experts and colleagues in the Digital Service to design data models that reflect the complexities of Parliament.
