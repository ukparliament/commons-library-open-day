# Select committees

## What do we do?
In the House of Commons, there is a select committee to scrutinise each government department. These are known as the departmental select committees. There are also cross-cutting select committees that look at policies across departments â€” for example, on the environment and sustainable development and past public spending. Select committees are cross-party groups of backbench MPs who work as a team to produce reports and other information.
