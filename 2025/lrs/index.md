# Library Resources Section

## What do we do?
The Library Resources Section (LRS) is a busy and supportive team. We manage the House of Commons Library's online resources, collections of books, pamphlets, official publications, serials and newspapers, and the collection of hardcopy and digital parliamentary papers. The team is also responsible for the Library’s digitisation programme, for the binding and conservation of Library stock, and for the Library catalogue and discovery platform. We divide this work between three teams:

**Acquisitions and Online** - manages and provides access to a range of information resources, including press aggregators, biographical resources, and legal and subject specific databases. The team trials, purchases, manages and promotes resources and ensures our users can find and use them. We ensure that procurement and financial rules are followed.  

Resources available to all Parliamentary users can be found from the Commons Library website Resources pages. Some resources are limited to Library staff only and made available through our SharePoint site.

**Cataloguing, Digitisation and Systems** - manages the House of Commons Library management system (Koha) and discovery platform (Summon). The team makes sure that hardcopy and digital resources are catalogued, classified and discoverable. They also look after data analytics for Library stock usage. The team is developing an ambitious project to digitise and preserve archived parliamentary material and responds to public access requests for digitisation of this material. 

**Collection Management**- responsible for the management of the Library’s hardcopy collections, which are held both on the parliamentary estate and in offsite storage. We own the Library’s Collection Development Policy, organising stock and making sure it is appropriately recorded and discoverable, retrieving and returning material requested by users, conservation measures, and responding to incidents that threaten the collections. A large part of the team’s work in recent years is stock moves, in particular some large scale moves in preparation for Parliament’s Restoration & Renewal project.

The team is also responsible for storing and recording the Library’s digital collection of parliamentary papers.
