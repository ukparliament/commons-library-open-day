# Library Resources Section

## What do we do?
The Library Resources Section (LRS) is a busy and supportive team. We manage the House of Commons Library's online resources, collections of books, pamphlets, official publications, serials and newspapers, and the collection of hardcopy and digital parliamentary papers. The team is also responsible for the Library’s digitisation programme, for the binding and conservation of Library stock, and for the Library catalogue and discovery platform. We divide this work between three teams:

**Acquisitions and Online** - managing and providing access to a range of information resources, including press aggregators, biographical resources, and legal and subject specific databases. We trial, purchase, manage and promote our resources. We ensure that procurement and financial rules are followed.  

Resources available to all Parliamentary users can be found from the Commons Library website Resources pages. Some resources are limited to Library staff only and made available through our SharePoint site.

**Cataloguing, Digitisation and Systems** - managing the House of Commons Library management system (Koha) and discovery platform (Summon). We make sure that hardcopy and digital resources are catalogued, classified and discoverable. We also look after data analytics for Library stock usage. We're developing an ambitious project to digitise and preserve archived parliamentary material and handle public access requests for digitisation of this material. 

**Collection Management**- responsible for the management of the Library’s hardcopy collections, which are held both on the parliamentary estate and in offsite storage. We own the Library’s Collection Development Policy, organising stock and making sure it is appropriately recorded and discoverable, retrieving and returning material requested by users, conservation measures, and responding to incidents that threaten the collections. In recent years we've been very busy with large scale stock moves in preparation for [Parliament’s Restoration & Renewal programme](https://www.restorationandrenewal.uk/).

The team is also responsible for storing and recording the Library’s digital collection of parliamentary papers.
