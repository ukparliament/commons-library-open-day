# Library Resources Section

## What do we do?
The Library Resources Section (LRS) is a busy and supportive team, in the Library Services directorate of R&I. We manage the House of Commons Library's online resources, important collection of books, pamphlets, Official Publications, serials, and newspapers, as well as the collection of hardcopy and digital parliamentary papers. The team is also responsible for the Library’s digitisation programme, the binding and conservation of library stock, and the Library catalogue and discovery platform.

There are 3 smaller teams within LRS:

**Acquisitions and Online** - manages and provides access to a range of information resources, including press aggregators, legal databases and biographical resources to subject specific databases.  The team arranges trials, purchases resources, manages and promotes those resources and ensure our users can find them using tools we make available. They also ensure that all procurement and financial rules are followed.  

Our resources which are available to all Parliamentary users can be found via the Commons Library website Resources page. We do have some resources which are restricted to Research and Information staff only and they are available through our internal SharePoint site.

**Cataloguing, Digitisation and Systems** - manages the House of Commons Library management system (Koha) and discovery platform (Summon). The team makes sure that hardcopy and electronic Library resources are catalogued, classified and discoverable. They also look after data analytics in relation to Library stock usage. 

The team is responsible for an ongoing project to digitise and preserve archived parliamentary material and it also responds to public access requests for the digitisation of this material. 

**Collection Management**- responsible for the management of the Library’s hardcopy collections, which are held both on the parliamentary estate and in offsite storage. This includes maintaining the Library’s Collection Development Policy, organising stock and making sure it is appropriately recorded and discoverable, retrieving and returning material requested by users, conservation measures, and responding to incidents that threaten the collections. A large part of the team’s work in recent years is stock moves, in particular some large scale moves in preparation for Parliament’s Restoration & Renewal project.

The team is also responsible for storing and recording the Library’s digital collection of parliamentary papers.
