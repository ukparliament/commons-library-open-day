# Library Resources Section

## What do we do?
The Library Resources Section (LRS) is a busy and supportive team. We manage the House of Commons Library's online resources, the collections of books, pamphlets, official publications, serials and newspapers, and the collection of hardcopy and digital parliamentary papers. We're also responsible for the Library’s digitisation programme, for the binding and conservation of Library stock, and for the Library catalogue and discovery platform. We share this work across three teams:

**Acquisitions and Online** - managing and providing access to a range of information resources, including press aggregators, biographical resources, and legal and subject specific databases. We trial, purchase, manage and promote our resources. We ensure that procurement and financial rules are followed. Resources available to all Parliamentary users are provided through [our pages on the Commons Library website](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/resources/). Some resources are limited to Library staff only and made available through our SharePoint site.

**Cataloguing, Digitisation and Systems** - managing the House of Commons Library management system (Koha) and discovery platform (Summon). We make sure that hardcopy and digital resources are catalogued, classified and discoverable. We also look after data analytics for Library stock usage. We're developing an ambitious project to digitise and preserve archived parliamentary material and handle public access requests for digitisation of this material. 

**Collection Management**- responsible for the management of the Library’s hardcopy collections, both on the parliamentary estate and in offsite storage. We own the Library’s Collection Development Policy, organise stock and make sure it is appropriately recorded and discoverable, retrieve and return material requested by users, manage conservation and respond to incidents that threaten the collections. We're also responsible for storing and recording the Library’s digital collection of parliamentary papers. In recent years we've been very busy with large scale stock moves in preparation for [Parliament’s Restoration & Renewal programme](https://www.restorationandrenewal.uk/).
